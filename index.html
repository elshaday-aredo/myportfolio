        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I originally never thought of this as a career- my passion is acting, but moreover, I desire to make an impact in the world! I want to be proof that it’s never too late to choose to be great; it’s never overdue to pivot in life and learn a new skill. I want to make myself proud and prove to myself that I can achieve anything I put my mind to. </p>
        <p> Over the course of Thinkful, although initially challenging, I have grown to love and be more comfortable with the problem solving aspects. Like I noted earlier, I especially enjoy the front end facet. And, I am excited to begin collaborating with my peers to create excellent products. </p>
