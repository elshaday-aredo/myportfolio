    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> I am a super outgoing personality and love to hang out with friends, family, and my pups Mouse and Hugo(I'm a fur-mom). You will most likely catch me outside (no pun intended) doing a fun outdoor activity like hiking and kayaking, or just playing a boardgame spending quality time with my loved ones. But, I also love a rainy day in when I can just be to myself and read my bible, a novel, or autobiography; so I call myself an introverted extrovert or vice versa. </p>
    <p> I originally never thought of this as a career- my passion is acting, but moreover, I desire to make an impact in the world! I want to be proof that itâ€™s never too late to choose to be great; it's never overdue to pivot in life and learn a new skill. I want to make myself proud and prove that I can achieve anything I put my mind to. </p>
    <p> Over the course of Thinkful, although initially challenging, I have grown to love and be more comfortable with the problem solving aspects. Like I noted earlier, I especially enjoy the front end facet. And, I am excited to begin collaborating with my peers to create excellent products. </p>
