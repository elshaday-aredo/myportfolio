    <p> My name is Elshaday, pronounced "El Shaddai", like the Amy Grant Song, but you can just call me Elle. I am a junior Software Developer in the making, living in Dallas, Texas.</p>

    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> I originally never thought of this as a career- my passion is acting, but moreover, I want to make an impact in the world! I want to be proof that it’s never too late to choose to be great. It’s never too late to pivot in life and learn a new skill. I want to make myself proud, I want to prove to myself that I can achieve anything I put my mind to. </p>
    <p> Over the course of Thinkful, although initially challenging, I have grown to love and be more comfortable with the problem solving aspects. Like I noted earlier, I especially enjoy the front end facet. And, I am excited to begin collaborating with my peers to create excellent products. </p>
